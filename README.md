## Description
* A classic rock, paper and scissors game
* Any two remote players can enter a game room and play the game
* Server capable of handling multiple games being played across multiple rooms simultaneously
* Graceful shutdown when a player leaves room
* Latency less than 30ms

## Working
* Uses socket.io to implement real time communication.
* Player 1 opens a room with any room code.
* Sends room code to Player 2.
* Player 2 joins room with given room code. Once both players present in room, game starts.
* Server maintains an instance of game logic against the room code and broadcasts state of game to all sockets belonging to a room. While, each client emits playerâ€™s choice to the server. Game logic is entirely handled on server side and client maintains only the present state of game.
